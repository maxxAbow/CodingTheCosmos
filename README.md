# { *Coding the Cosmos* }

## Description

This web application displays various information about weather data and photographs captured from the Mars Rover, *Curiosity*.

`*Curiosity* is a car-sized Mars rover designed to explore the Gale crater on Mars as part of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission. *Curiosity* was launched from Cape Canaveral on November 26, 2011, at 15:02:00 UTC and landed on Aeolis Palus inside Gale crater on Mars on August 6, 2012, 05:17:57 UTC.`

We were genuinely **curious** to explore Mars. So we decided to create *Coding the Cosmos*. It was quite the expedition.

We used calls to NASA's API and JS to display data (Weather Information & Photographs) from the Curiosity Rover on our website.

We also used Bootstrap to layout the overall structure of the webpage. Using features like Modal to avoid using those ugly lil Alerts. *Woof...*

Please enjoy!
